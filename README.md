I'm Mathilde Ritman, a climate physicist and PhD Reseracher at the University of Oxford. 

I love all things weather and climate. Currently, I'm most interested in research related to:

- Clouds and radiation
- Climate extremes

I work with large and unwieldy datasets and statistical and data science tools, namely:
- Satellite data and remote sensing
- High-resolution climate models
- Machine and deep learning
